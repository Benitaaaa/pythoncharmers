https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/29/business/starbucks-union-wages/index.html,"Starbucks violated federal labor law when it increased wages and offered new perks and benefits only to non-union employees, a National Labor Relations Board judge found Thursday.

The decision is the latest in a series of NLRB rulings finding that Starbucks has violated labor law in its efforts to stop unions from forming in its coffee shops.

“The issue at the heart of this case is whether, under current Board law, [Starbucks] was entitled to explicitly reward employees,” for not participating in union activity, “while falsely telling its workers that the federal labor law forced it to take this action,” wrote administrative law judge Mara-Louise Anzalone. “It was not.”"

Su Wenqiang, 32, admitted to 11 charges of money laundering, possessing proceeds from illegal remote gambling offences and lying to get work passes for himself and his wife.

More than S$3 billion (US$2.2 billion) in assets have been seized or frozen in relation to the case. This likely makes it one of the largest money laundering operations in the world.

Su was among 10 suspects arrested in simultaneous police raids last August. The Cambodian national, whose passport states that he is from Fujian, was nabbed in a Good Class Bungalow along Lewis Road in Bukit Timah."
https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/22/tech/meta-facebook-data-privacy-eu-fine/index.html,"Meta has been fined a record-breaking €1.2 billion ($1.3 billion) by European Union regulators for violating EU privacy laws by transferring the personal data of Facebook users to servers in the United States.

The European Data Protection Board announced the fine in a statement Monday, saying it followed an inquiry into Facebook (FB) by the Irish Data Protection Commission, the chief regulator overseeing Meta’s operations in Europe.

The move highlights ongoing uncertainty about how global businesses may legally transfer EU users’ data to servers overseas.

The EU regulator said the processing and storage of personal data in the United States contravened Europe’s signature data privacy law, known as the General Data Protection Regulation. Chapter 5 of the GDPR sets out the conditions under which personal data can be transferred to third countries or international organizations."

Zhang pleaded guilty on Tuesday to two counts of forgery-related offences and one of failing to satisfactorily account for property reasonably suspected to be benefits from criminal conduct."
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/05/politics/liberty-university-fined-campus-safety/index.html,"The Department of Education imposed a record $14 million fine on Liberty University, a Christian college located in Virginia, over violations of a campus safety law, officials said Tuesday.

The Department of Education said it was the largest fine ever imposed for violating the Clery Act, which requires colleges to maintain and disclose campus crime statistics and security information.

Liberty University also agreed to spend an additional $2 million to improve on-campus safety over the next two years.

The Department of Education initiated the review in 2022 after receiving complaints that alleged the college committed violations of the Clery Act. The review also followed a 2021 lawsuit, in which 12 women claimed that the school created an environment that increased the likelihood of sexual assault and rape. The case was settled in 2022."
https://www.euronews.com/2024/02/23/judge-convicts-former-austrian-chancellor-sebastian-kurz,"After twelve days of deliberation, a Vienna court has delivered its verdict on the trial of former Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.

He has been convicted of making false statements to a parliamentary inquiry.

The verdict at the Vienna criminal court followed a four-month trial.

The case marked the first time in more than 30 years that a former Austrian chancellor had stood trial.

He was given an eight-month suspended sentence. 

Kurz, who was once hailed as a ""wunderkind"" of the Austrian People's Party, resigned in 2021 following a separate corruption probe. 

Prosecutors in the trial, which opened in October, accused the 37-year-old of giving false evidence in June 2020 during an inquiry regarding his role in setting up a holding company named OeBAG. "
