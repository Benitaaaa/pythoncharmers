On 23 June 2004, ITF investigators interviewed the Divisional Manager, who explained that

for the Capital Expenditure from the KTA.",45.pdf
Capital Expenditure,KTA,"2
Confronted with the documents that showed he/she had signed the X-Ray Contract with the

The fact that the Divisional Manager signed a Contract and Letter of Notification before 
receiving the signed Capital Expenditure Approval from the KTA should be seen as a minor 
administrative irregularity, particularly since he/she instructed KTA Official 1 by 
memorandum of 23 June 2003 (three days after KTA’s approval) to inform the supplier of 
the agreement of the contract.",45.pdf

adequate training in the handling of procurement matters: 
Recommendation 2: That airport staff responsible for procurement activity strictly adhere to
