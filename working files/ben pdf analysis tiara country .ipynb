satisfactory monitoring and approval of expenditure There is no written documentation for authorizing travel and no standard forms for tracking travelrelated expenses which are vulnerable to fraud and should be approved and monitored more closely by management  Throughout  and clearly up to February  the ATCS Management in particular the ATCS Official and the Division Manager failed to provide effective oversight of the financial operations especially those related to cash at the ATCS Finance Office  Documentation obtained by the ITF from the Prishtina Airport clearly shows that ATCS management failed to introduce or enforce rules and regulations that would guarantee proper use of the allocated funds and provided transparent documentation of this process  of   A significant amount of the cash withdrawals by the ATCS was used for training opportunities for employees of the ATCS who attended courses in a number of countries including Italy Canada and the United Kingdom Therefore the cash advances were not all related to the ATCS Officials travel rather for a significant number of Employees The necessity of the frequent travel of the ATCS Official remains questionable as the available documentation does not provide clear proof that the ATCS Officials travel was business related or justified  By way of example ITF Investigators examined available files related to travel in  which included details of staff attending courses This examination was related to the situation before and also after  July  Note n  July  the Pristina Airport was handed over by UNMIK Pillar  to UNMIK Pillar   KTA It was established that at least in nine cases    and      there were significant irregularities related to distribution of funds documentation and filings of those financial records Having examined those listed files it was clearly established that in cases    and  spending of   was not properly documented It is possible that those funds were in fact used for what they had been initially allocated However the documentation that was available to the ITF does not support this assumption In case  an overpayment of  was made without explanation as to where the additional funds were drawn These findings clearly demonstrate the disarray at the ATCS Finance Office in   The ATCS financial documentation revealed that the ATCS Official was certifying hisher own expenses for official travel It was clearly established by the ITF investigation that the ATCS Official made a number of reimbursement claims for food and restaurant bills or refreshments that were not properly authorized Heshe also at least in one case did not repay  to the petty cash fund from request No  Additionally the ATCS Official Official  and Official  retained a sum of  of their DSAperdiem for a business trip to the United Kingdom in May  even though they had been provided with free transport food and accommodation request   In June  the ATCS Official certified perdiem of   for nine Department  trainees that were supposed to participate in meteorology training in the UK Two Department  staff failed their initial examination and prematurely returned to Prishtina The remaining seven trainees signed for their perdiem in total  The ITF investigation established that request  does not contain any documentation with regards to what was done with a sum of  initially allocated by the ATCS Official for perdiem of those two ATCS employees  It was established that the ATCS Finance Office used an excel spreadsheet and had no alternative computerized system to deal with financial documentation  of  The procedure used required manual inputting of details of individual bank accounts into the spreadsheet before reconciling expenditure and income against the bank account', 'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL'}\n",

month of February  ', 'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE'}, {'source': 'United States', 'target': 'United States', 'sentence': 'At the time no further details were provided to IDOIOS regarding how the complainant was aware of the fact that the Fuel Cell was unable to account for the US nor in what way Officer  was involved with the matter  As a result of the investigation by IDOIOS into the allegation against Officer  it was determined that although it was true that an audit by Internal Audit Division  of OIOS IADOIOS had discovered that for the period  August  to  March   gallons of fuel valued at US could not be accounted for by UNMIL there was no evidence suggesting that Officer  was personally responsible for the discrepancy II BACKGROUND INFORMATION  UNMIL was established on  September  by Security Council Resolution  Officer  was responsible for establishing the UNMIL Fuel Cell at the start of the mission having previously served as an Officer with the Mission des Nations Unies au Rpublique Dmocratique de Congo MONUC', 'sentiment': 'NEGATIVE'}, {'source': 'Liberia', 'target': 'United States', 'sentence': 'Any unreasonable act or failure to act which as a direct result of a failure to exercise due care causes loss to the Organization IV METHODOLOGY  IDOIOS conducted interviews with all parties concerned other than Officer  himself and reviewed all relevant documentation V INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS IADOIOS Audit AP Fuel Management in UNMIL  Prior to travelling to Liberia to investigate the allegations against Officer  IDOIOS reviewed the IADOIOS audit report Amongst other matters raised in the report IADOIOS noted that for the period  August  to  March   gallons of fuel valued at US could not be accounted for The Auditors noted that there had been an investigation by UNMILs Special Investigation Unit SIU into allegations that UNMIL fuel was being sold by bowser drivers to third parties and that the investigation had concluded that there was credible evidence against some of the bowser drivers and their supervisor As a result of the investigation the supervisor and the drivers involved were dismissed Since the supervisor in question was the one responsible for the monitoring of deliveries and the completion of bowser log sheets IADOIOS concluded that irregularities in the distribution could account for the gallon discrepancy   The IADOIOS Auditors made a total of  recommendations to UNMIL regarding the way that the mission managed fuel The mission accepted all but one of the recommendations this recommendation was subsequently withdrawn by IADOIOS and has implemented them SIU Investigation SIUMON  Upon receipt of information on  March  that UNMIL bowser drivers were selling UNMIL fuel to local vendors in Monrovia and other parts of Liberia the SIU initiated an investigation into the allegations The SIU investigation revealed that some locally hired drivers employed to deliver fuel to various UNMIL installations were selling a portion of the fuel they were transporting to local vendors The SIU found that the theft and sale of UNMIL fuel was organised by the drivers supervisor and that it had begun soon after the mission commenced in  As a result of the investigation the supervisor and the drivers identified by the SIU were dismissed There was no evidence disclosed during the SIU investigation to suggest that Officer  was in any way involved in the theft and subsequent resale of the fuel IDOIOS Investigation  The original complainant in the case was interviewed by IDOIOS He stated that he had no personal knowledge of either the problems with the Fuel Cell accounts or of any involvement of Officer  in the problems identified He claimed that he had become aware as a result of his position in the mission that an audit was being conducted into the Fuel Cell accounts and that an amount of approximately US could not be accounted for This was the information that he had communicated to IDOIOS along with the fact that Officer  was an Officer of the Fuel Cell at the time The complainant was unable to provide any further information to IDOIOS about the matter under investigation  ', 'sentiment': 'NEUTRAL'}]\n",
